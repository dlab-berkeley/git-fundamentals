git-fundamentals
================

Okay, I am adding an edit now.

A starting point for discovering the wonderful world of Git, GitHub, and Git
Annex (Assistant)

## Concepts

Let's avoid this [humorous, yet sad situation from PhD
Comics](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531).

1. What is Git?
    - A version control system, collaboration tool, and general awesomesauce.
    - If you forget today, click "Help" at the top of any GitHub page
2. What is GitHub?
    - It's a web app
    - There's also a desktop app
    - And even a mobile app!
3. What is Git good at?
    - "Small" "text" files.
    - Synchronization
    - Collaboration
4. *Extra credit:* What is Git Annex?
    - A companion to git for big files
    - We'll cover this in depth if there's time.

## Getting the tools / Setup

 - Sign up for [github](https://github.com), and **verify your email**.
 - Command line tools (you'll need this!):
    - GitHub recommends the [official Git installer](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
    - **I** recommend [homebrew](http://brew.sh) for hackers on OS X
    - And it's easier to use your package manager (apt, yum, ...) for Unix, etc.
 - GUI tools
    - Windows & Mac, also supports hg: [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
    - Lightweight Mac client: [GitX-dev](http://rowanj.github.io/gitx/)
    - Lightweight GTK client: [gitg](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gitg) (get it
      with your package manager).
    - Integrated with file manager:
        - [TortoiseGit](https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/) on Windows
        - [RabbitVCS](http://rabbitvcs.org/) on Linux (also integrates with gedit)
    - Many [others](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) are available, and you
      can search for even more!
 - Integration for your text editor!
    - Vim [fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)
    - [Emacs](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Git)
    - [Sublime Text 2](https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-git)
    - gedit (use RabbitVCS)

## Awesome resources

 - [Basic commands cheat sheet(s)](http://git-scm.com/docs) (Note the links to
   other cheat sheets!)
 - [Gamified git](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/)
 - GitHub sponsors [this](http://try.github.io/).
 - Where does "help" go from GitHub? [Here](https://help.github.com/).
 - @davclark is an awesome resource, himself! (when he's not being a jerk)
 - [Linux commands cheat sheet](http://www.pixelbeat.org/cmdline.html) (also
   mostly works for OS X command line).
 - [git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
 - [The visual github guide](http://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html)

### Local Git expositors at UC Berkeley

 - A problem-focused exploration of git features is available in @jkitzes' [Data
   Science Lessons](http://jkitzes.github.io/datasci-lessons/)
 - [An IPython
   notebook](https://github.com/fperez/reprosw/blob/master/Version%20Control.ipynb)
   (of course!) from @fperez.
 - [Lots of exposition](http://matthew-brett.github.io/pydagogue) on git + other
   mostly python stuff and [python scripts for a standardized git
   workflow](https://github.com/matthew-brett/gitwash) from @matthew-brett.
 - [Tons of R code to access public
   APIs](http://ropensci.org/packages/index.html) from @karthik and the
   @rOpenSci team.

## Fancy GitHub features

Map diffs are amazing:

 - [Explore the history of markers for restaurants](https://github.com/DU-GIS/Geojson_Data/blob/master/Restaurants.geojson)
 - [See how congressional redistricting looks](https://github.com/benbalter/congressional-districts/commit/2233c76ca5bb059582d796f053775d8859198ec5#diff-85d2c1b78193e963475250414e57940b)

CSV diffs are strangely not as good, but (properly formatted) CSV is displayed
nicely and is searchable:

 - [A tables of S&P 500 securities](https://github.com/datasets/s-and-p-500-companies/blob/master/data/constituents-financials.csv)

## Forking! What's that?

Forking on github is same as cloning in the command line.
